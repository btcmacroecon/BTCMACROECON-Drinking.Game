INSTRUCTIONS:

<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">***Special Instruction: Please take the car keys away from everybody playing and hide them, seriously.</span></strong>

Welcome to Bitcoin Macroeconomics Drinking Game! Everybody drink! The person that supplied the BTCMACROECON tokens for the game and the gas (Ethereum) to run the network gets to make a rule. X BTCMACROECON means X equals (=) a constant amount of tokens so determine that before the game starts and be consistent. Begin the game at START and proceed by clicking on the icons that will take you to a new web page, and once complete, click back to the board game here.

Donations are greatly appreciated! <strong>0x0e86fa24486e9de0550540537ae65f3eed414172</strong>
